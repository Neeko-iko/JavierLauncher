# Javier
Javier is a minecraft server launcher that is intended for those who have multiple servers in a folder, but only run 1 at a time
This is an experimental build of Javier for testing multiprocessing. Please check out the [main project](https://github.com/Neeko-iko/JavierLauncher) for something stable.
This build also aims to port the Linux exclusive Javier features to Windows. Please check the progress log for more details.



# Building from source
 - Download and install Python 3.10
 - run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - if this doesn't work i forgot to update it lol sorry dl the missing modules

for Linux users, an Xterm install is needed as well.

# FAQ
> What is this garbage code?

idk

> Why not just continue develop the main build of Javier? Why is this a fork?

I figure everything in the main repository which is maintained by both myself and Javier's creator should be
at least functional to a degree and have a planned release. This might never go anywhere.

> Why is progress slow?

I'm a college student learning to multiprocess and thread in Python to help a friend out with some coding troubles

> What are these .QSS files?

It's like CSS but cuter (because Qt uses it get it)

> Some of the code comments seem odd?

I am mostly writing them to explain to Neeko what has changed from her repo, and I didn't remove any of her comments.
Sorry if it's hard to follow
